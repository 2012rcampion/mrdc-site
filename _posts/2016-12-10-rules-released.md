We have released the first version of the rules for this year's competition.  You can find it on the [public drive]({{ site.google_drive }}) and embedded below.  Changes from last year's rules have been highlighted in red, but we strongly suggest reading the entire thing.

Keep in mind that this is a preliminary version of the rules, and that game rules will be modified and clarified as the mechanics are developed.

If you have any questions, please send them to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and we will answer them as soon as we are able.
