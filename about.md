The Midwestern Robotics Design Competition Committee is made up of college students from various majors such as Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Industrial Engineering. Each of us on the committee is devoted to ensuring the success of this competition. The objectives we aim to accomplish are to:

* provide a fair and safe competition of high quality that truly tests the skills of competitors and helps push the boundaries of creativity and innovation;

* promote communication and collaboration between teams to impart interpersonal skills and encourage inquisitive minds to explore; both important aspects of a successful STEM student;

* promote and develop relations with organizations and corporations with an interest in STEM education.
